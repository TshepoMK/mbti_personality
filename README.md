# MBTI Personality
During my academic year at Explore Data Science Academy we had a personality Sprint, using NLP to determine a person's personality type based on what they comment

## Natural Language Processing
## Voting Classifier (Multiple Algorithms)

* This project utilized various NLP Techniques to classify comment as belong to four classes
* Introvert Vs Extrovert `(I/E)`
* Intuitive Vs Sensing `(N/S)`
* Feeling Vs Thinking `(F/T)`
* Perceptive Vs Judgement `(P/J`)
* Ultimately I used a `Voting Classifier` for my predictions, my classifier consisted of five models working together
* 1. Support vector Machine
* 2. Multi layered perceptron
* 3. Extreme Boosted classifier (XGB)
* 4. Random Forest
* 5. And Lastly Gradient Boosted Classifier
